This is my personal site's experimental WordPress theme. I'm using it as a playground to teach myself how themes work on a very fundamental level. I'm experimenting with varying technologies and things will often break, so I do _not_ recommend utilizing this theme for use on client sites. It's designed to suit my needs, not those of a business (ie: it doesn't scale very well and it could definitely be more optimized).

## Getting Started

At the moment there is no official release files for my theme. That said, in order to get the theme functioning you'll need to leverage `npm`. After you've extracted the theme files to your `/wp-content/theme/` directory, navigate to it via Terminal then run `npm install`.

After `npm install` has finished running, you'll need to run `gulp` to compile all of the `.scss` into `.css` files. Then you're good to go!
